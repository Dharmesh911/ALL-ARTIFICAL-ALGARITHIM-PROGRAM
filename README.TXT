This is the project README file. This file can be open in BlueJ program.
This program is not mine and it can be used for study purpose only. Before 
executing the program you should change the puzzle number within all the
algorithm files but do not change the goal state number. This will show 
all the states of A* search, Best first search, Depth search and Breadth 
first search.  


Thank you...
